**1.1**

Representation: 3 arrays representing the stacks (at most we can have 3 stacks), being the first element, the one on the bottom of the stack and the last the one at the top

Initial state: 
Ex: [2,1,3] [5,4] []
or [4,1][3,5,2][]

Final state: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1][][]

Operators:

* move a block to the floor:
    - pre-conditions: there can not be already 3 stacks with elements

* move a block on top of a block:
    - pre-conditions: the block on top has to have a higher value than the block being moved
