Which node is expanded next using each of the following methods:

**Breadth-First Seacrh**  

 Nodes at lowest depth are expanded first => C, D


**Depth-First Search**

Always expand one of the deepest nodes in the tree => E, F, G, H 

**Uniform Cost Search**

Always expand the border node with the lowest cost => D

**Greedy Search** 

Tries to expand the node with the best heuristic = lowest cost => C

**A* Algorithm Search**

Lowest value of f(n) = g(n) + h(n) => G
