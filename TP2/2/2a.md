**Formulate the problem as a search problem indicating the state representation,
operators (their names, preconditions, effects, and cost), initial state, and objective
test.**

### State Representation

The state of this problem can be represented like a matrix, a list of lists:

Ex:
[
    [1,2,3,4],
    [5,6,7,8],
    [9,10,11,12],
    [13,14,15,0]
]


### Initial State

The initial state can be any permutation of the 15 numbers.

### Objective

The objective is for the final state to be the initial state ordered, where the 0 is the last cell.

### Operators

There are two ways of doing the operators: either we have 4 operators for each cell, with the boundaries limits or we only move the empty state.

Restrictions: in the corners there are only two operators, on the rest of the edges there are only three operators and the rest has four operators.
